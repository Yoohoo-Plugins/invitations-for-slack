Build a Slack community by allowing your visitors (or registered users) to invite themselves to your Slack team.

== Description ==
Invitations for Slack lets you use convenient shortcodes to show "Join us on Slack." buttons or Slack badges. Just add
your Slack token and use the shortcodes wherever you want your visitors to be able to invite themselves from.

### Features:

* Easy to use:
    * Visit <https://api.slack.com/web> to generate your Slack token.
    * Add the token to the plugin settings.
    * Use the [invitations_for_slack] or [invitations_for_slack_badge] shortcodes.
* Invitations are performed using the WP REST API which in turn communicates the Slack API. No page reloads.

### Requirements:

* A Slack team and the team's access token.
* A self-/hosted WordPress website (Not a WordPress.com website.)

== Installation ==

After installing you will need to add your Slack API token to the plugin settings.
